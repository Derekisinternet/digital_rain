# TO DO

[x] iterate columns radomly
[ ] BUG: columns more frequently iterate on the left side of the screen
  [ ] - fix issue with items not getting deleted from array
  [ ] - possible fix: take halfway index, then iterate twice: one above half, the other below
[x] have characters disappear from view
[ ] multiple raindrops per column
[ ] white cursor on leading character
